# SATD-decide restructure: pure-C speed parity with x264 medium

The plan for closing the pure-C speed gap by matching x264's *candidate
discipline*: decide by SATD, run RD only on survivors, screen intra instead of
encoding it, and keep trellis off the trial path. Each workstream is gated per
section 7 and reverted if it fails.

## 1. Objective and bars

**Goal:** pure-C `next264 --preset medium` matches pure-C `x264 --preset medium`
(matched `--ref 1 --bframes 2 --cabac --transform-8x8`, threads 1) on
wall-clock, **without lower quality than x264**.

Two bars, decoupled:

- **Speed target:** corpus geomean wall-clock ratio (next264/x264, both scalar,
  `--crf`, `scripts/perf-comp-purec.sh` protocol) driven to **<= 1.0x**.
- **Quality invariant (per step):** 7-clip VMAF-NEG BD vs x264 medium must not
  *increase* from the baseline by more than **+0.10% mean**, and no single clip
  by more than **+0.5%**, for any shipped step. Recon-match green, subme>=9
  byte-identical to HEAD, threaded==serial canary green, unit suite green,
  every step.

The decoupling matters. If the baseline shows BD margin (mean below 0), the
margin may be spent on the two known speed-for-quality trades (A3, A5) as long
as the mean stays <= 0. If it shows a deficit, those trades are frozen and only
the quality-neutral workstreams run; the deficit itself is mb-tree and motion
territory, not this program's scope, and must not be double-counted against
speed work.

**Preset semantics:** the target is `--preset medium` itself (the subme 7
band). No new preset. The subme>=9 default (max quality) stays byte-identical
throughout; every behavior change is `subme<=8`-gated with an env escape.

## 2. x264-medium anatomy (subme 7 -> i_mbrd=1, trellis=1)

Every claim source-checked:

1. **Decide by SATD, RD the survivors.** P: SATD analysis ranks
   {16x16(+refs), 8x8, 16x8, 8x16} plus SATD-screened intra; then
   `mb_analyse_p_rd` runs `rd_cost_mb` (a full MB encode: transform,
   **deadzone** quant, recon, CABAC size) only on candidates with
   SATD < `i_satd*5/4+1`, with 16x16 always admitted. Then
   `mb_analyse_transform_rd` on the winner only, and `intra_rd` at the same
   `5/4+1` threshold, which usually means zero intra RDs. Typical: **2-4 RD
   encodes per MB.** B is the same structure via `mb_analyse_b_rd` with
   threshold `*17/16+1`, and direct gated by `i_cost16x16direct <= i_cost*33/32`.
2. **No trellis in RD trials.** `h->mb.b_trellis = i_trellis > 1 && i_mbrd`, so
   at medium (trellis=1) **every RD trial quantizes with the plain deadzone**.
   Trellis runs exactly once, on the committed winner.
3. **Bounded subpel.** `<reference-internal>[7] = {0,0,2,2}`: 2 hpel and 2 qpel
   diamond iterations on every candidate, **no** extra winner refinement, never
   iterate to convergence. Integer search is hexagon (radius-2,
   follow-direction, me_range 16) plus one square refine; **no UMH at medium**
   (UMH starts at slower / subme 9).
4. **16x8/8x16 are derived, not searched fresh.** Their costs are estimated
   from the 8x8 SATDs (`<reference-internal>`), the search is seeded from the 8x8 MVs,
   and partition 1 is skipped when `part0_cost + est(part1) > i_best_satd * 5/4`.
5. **Intra in inter frames is screened, not encoded.** `mb_analyse_intra` is
   predict-plus-SATD per mode only. i8x8 entry is gated at
   `min(cost_so_far, i16satd) > (i_satd_inter*6)>>2` (1.5x inter); i4x4 uses a
   `min3*10/8` threshold with a per-mode bail. A neighbourhood heuristic
   (`b_fast_intra`) tightens i16 with a LUT. Intra is RD-coded only if it
   survives to `intra_rd`. Profile: **~70 self-samples**.
6. **Chroma in RD trials** is encoded but var2-pre-decimated. (next264's
   equivalent early-out measured at parity.)

## 3. next264 medium anatomy, and the delta

| per-MB operation | x264 medium | next264 medium | delta driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| P integer ME | hex+square, seeded; 16x8/8x16 seeded from 8x8 plus early-term | hex-to-convergence (32 iters cap) plus **UMH grid on 16x16 AND 16x8 x2 AND 8x16 x2**; every shape searched fresh from its own median | ME probe ~23% of self-time |
| P subpel | 2 hpel + 2 qpel diamond iters, all candidates | 8-neighbour square **iterated to convergence**, hpel+qpel, every search | probe_sub ~10% |
| P RD encodes | 2-4 (deadzone quant) | 1-2 (16x16 insurance always admitted, `rd_admit_16` default-open) but **each runs Viterbi RDOQ and full chroma** | RDOQ ~12% |
| trellis | once, at commit | inside **every** RD trial and intra trial | -- |
| intra in P/B | SATD screen (~70 samples) | `analyze_intra_g` **fully encodes i16** (fdct, RDOQ, recon, chroma, rate) on every MB; i4/i8 get only a 2x-margin early-out | intra ~625 samples (~9x) |
| B modes | SATD-rank all, RD survivors (17/16), direct 33/32-gated | threshold-survivor is near-parity; **intra still fully encoded**; direct always RD'd | -- |

So the fan-out story is precise: **next264 does not run more RD encodes than
x264. It runs a heavier ME per shape, a trellis-and-chroma-loaded encode per
trial, and a full intra encode per MB that x264 screens away.** Those three
asymmetries plus bounded-subpel discipline are the whole remaining algorithmic
gap.

## 4. The design: five workstreams

Everything `subme<=8`-gated, env-escaped, subme>=9 byte-identical.

### W-A: ME discipline

- **A1. Parent/sibling seed chaining.** Thread the 16x16 winner MV (per ref)
  and the co-located 8x8 winner MVs into the 16x8/8x16/8x8 searches as seeds.
  next264 restarts each shape from its own spatial median.
- **A2. 16x8/8x16 cost-estimation early-termination.** Compute
  `<reference-internal>[]` from the 8x8 SATD phase and skip the partition-1 search
  when `part0 + est > best_so_far * 5/4`. Requires ordering the SATD phase
  16x16 -> 8x8 -> {16x8, 8x16}; today all four run unconditionally.
- **A3. UMH scope narrowing.** UMH-16only measured 19% speed at +0.62% BD.
  Margin-bound. Keep UMH on 16x16 regardless: it is next264's compensation for
  hex reach on zoom content, and it is measured as real basin-escape work, not
  redundant.
- **A4. Hex iteration cap** 32 -> ~8 with A1 seeds. Byte-inequivalent, BD-gated.
- **A5. Subpel iteration discipline** = x264's `{0,0,2,2}`, 2+2 capped diamond
  on all candidates. Measured at +1.36% BD mean. The canonical margin-spend
  lever: only if the baseline shows at least that much margin.

### W-B: intra screening

Replace next264's always-encode-i16 in P/B analysis with x264's structure:

- **B1.** SATD mode screen: predict each i16 mode, `satd16x16`, keep the best,
  **no transform, quant or recon**. Compare against the inter SATD winner and
  only run the full encode when the intra cost is competitive, letting it into
  the RD tournament. Otherwise intra is out with no encode at all.
- **B2.** Keep the i4/i8 2x early-out inside the survivor path, and add x264's
  i8x8 entry gate (1.5x inter) plus the i4x4 per-mode bail.
- **B3.** Same screen in `analyze_b_mb`; its intra trial is identical dead
  weight on B MBs, which are the majority at bframes 2.
- Risk: intra-cheap content (akiyo) leans on intra in P, so the screen must not
  starve it. Sentinel akiyo and foreman in the BD gate.

### W-C: trellis/RDOQ placement (x264 trellis=1 semantics)

- **C1.** RD trials (`inter_rd_score`, `eval_b_*`, the intra trial) quantize
  with the plain deadzone (`n264_quant_*`), no Viterbi, and J comes from that.
  The **commit** path re-encodes the winner once with the full Viterbi RDOQ.
- **C2.** If C1's BD holds, drop the per-trial chroma Viterbi to deadzone too.

### W-D: B-path completion

- **D1.** Gate the always-RD'd B_Direct with x264's `direct <= best*33/32` SATD
  admission. Needs one satd16x16 on the already-built `dp`, nearly free.
- **D2.** B intra screen, which is W-B3.

### W-E: quality-neutral constant-factor experiments

The candidate-discipline arithmetic does not reach 1.0x alone; the rest is
per-op constants. Each is a bounded experiment with a wall-clock gate (>= 2% on
2 clips or revert, byte-identical required):

- **E1. Stride-16 fenc/analysis cache.** Copy the MB's source (and hot pred)
  into contiguous stride-16 buffers once per MB; every SATD/SAD probe then
  reads fully-utilized cache lines instead of frame-stride planes. x264's
  single biggest structural cache advantage, and entirely output-invariant.
  Touches probe plumbing widely, so prototype on the P 16x16 path first.
- **E2. Snapshot/ctx slimming:** `save_mb_rec` copies and est-ctx 1KB memcpys
  shrink proportionally once W-A..C cut the trial count. Re-profile first.

## 5. What each workstream measured

**Baseline.** 2.65x geomean pure-C, and BD **-3.95%** at the unflagged crf30-46
sweep (+1.47% at crf24-40, where bus saturates), so next264 is ahead on quality
and the margin-bound levers A3 and A5 are live. Fresh both-encoder profiles
also invert the plan's premise: **ME and SATD are at PARITY with x264** (6.6 vs
7.0; 17.3 vs 20.4), so W-A's "largest bucket" is already spent. The one large
asymmetry left is trellis placement, **31% vs 6.3%**.

**W-B (intra screening) shipped: ~12% speed** (2.84x -> 2.51x) at BD +0.009%,
i.e. neutral. x264's own 9/8 threshold failed the BD gate here at +0.48%; the
retuned 2x margin is neutral. That is the standing evidence that x264's
thresholds must be re-tuned against next264's fallback balance, not copied.

**W-A is tapped out.**

- A1 (parent-seed chaining) reverted: 0% speed, because the ME seeds are
  already saturated, and it breached BD (bus +0.96).
- A2 (est early-term) deferred: needs the invasive x264 cost-estimate plus a
  SATD reorder.
- A4 (hex cap) near-zero, since the hex already early-exits on convergence.
- D1 (direct gate) low value, since direct usually wins.

**W-C does not transfer.** Trellis-at-commit was built P-first with all
correctness gates green, and measured **BD +2.35% for ~2% speed**: the
deadzone-J decisions are worse, next264 was leaning on trellis-in-trials, and
the winner re-encode eats the savings. Closed.

So the quality-neutral half of the program is spent, and what remains is E1
(byte-identical, uncertain) plus the two margin-bound levers A3 (0-19%) and A5
(0-15%), which the baseline's BD margin now permits.

Abort criterion per step: if the BD gate fails after one bounded retune, revert
and log the root cause, then move on. No step ships disabled-by-default "for
later": ship on at medium, or revert.

## 6. Honest arithmetic to parity

Multiplying the mid-range expectations: B 1.06 x A1/A2 1.10 x A4/D1 1.04 x C
1.07 x A3 1.10 x A5 1.08 ~= **1.55x**, from ~2.4x to **~1.55x remaining**. The
candidate-discipline program alone does NOT reach parity; getting to <= 1.0x
needs E1-class constant-factor wins and/or fuller margin-spend on A3/A5 (their
maximum readings, 19% and 15%, are another ~1.4x if the margin allows both at
full strength, so ~1.1x). Both routes are measured, not assumed. If the gap
floors above 1.0x with the invariant binding, the remainder is by construction
the price of quality-above-x264: surface that number and let the owner decide
whether BD-parity-exact, spending ALL margin, is the ship point.

## 7. Measurement protocol (binding)

- Profile and BD **at `--crf`, never `--qp`** (the `--qp` path shifts mb-tree by
  ~30%). Wall-clock best-of-3 or better on a cool box.
- BD: `scripts/bdcompare.py --vmaf --no-cache`, robust multi-point sweep,
  7-clip corpus, **against x264 medium directly**, never against next264-self
  only.
- Every step: recon-match (medium band QPs), subme>=9 byte-identity against a
  fresh HEAD build, threaded==serial canary, ASan on one clip after any
  buffer-touching change.
- Sentinels: bus and stefan (motion), akiyo (static/intra), mobile (detail),
  foreman (mixed). A3/A5 margin decisions additionally check the broadened
  `--class` corpus.

## 8. Non-goals and standing dead ends

Do not re-open inside this program: batched sad_x3/x4 (SIMD tier), chroma
pre-decimate, UMH-off-everywhere, the 16x16-Bi/uni top-1 SATD gate (+3.2%),
winner-only-trellis without a re-encode, the mb-tree lowres cache (~0 at
`--crf`), lowres-ME motion levers, and any SIMD/NEON work (separate tier).
