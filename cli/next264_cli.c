/* --- 2-pass across GOP workers ---------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every other rate-control mode reaches the GOP-parallel path because none of
 * them carries state over a GOP boundary: ABR re-seeds abr_cum_target per
 * encoder, VBV re-primes its buffer full, CRF re-seeds its complexity
 * reference. Each GOP re-solves its own rate problem against the same target,
 * which is exactly why a GOP's bytes do not depend on which thread coded it.
 *
 * 2-pass is the one mode that does carry state, in both directions:
 *
 * pass 1 every worker would fopen(rc.stats, "w") on the SAME path and
 * truncate the others' lines -- last finisher wins.
 * pass 2 the reader slurps the whole file at encoder_open, sizes tp_target
 * from the whole stream's record count, and walks the records with a
 * bare tp_stats[tp_idx++] cursor that starts at 0. Every GOP would
 * plan itself against GOP 0's records and the entire clip's budget.
 *
 * So the exclusion at the call site is load-bearing, and the file format is
 * why: `type cplx bits qp` per record, matched to frames by POSITION alone,
 * with no frame index to seek on. Splitting it needs boundaries the file does
 * not have -- and they cannot be inferred by counting, because a frame dropped
 * on CAVLC overflow writes no record at all (rcp_drop, and the size == 0 early
 * return in w2_drain), so "records per GOP == frames per GOP" is not an
 * identity.
 *
 * The boundaries therefore get written down. Pass 1 gives each GOP its own
 * file and the merge stamps a marker ahead of each section:
 *
 * #gop <index> <first frame> <end frame> <records>
 *
 * Pass 2 splits on those markers, hands each worker its own section, and sizes
 * each worker's budget by that section's share of the global complexity sum --
 * NOT by its frame count. That distinction is the whole mode: an equal
 * per-frame budget per GOP would hit the target rate just as precisely while
 * refusing to move bits from an easy GOP to a hard one, which is the only
 * reason to run two passes.
 *
 * The markers are comments to the encoder's own reader, which skips them, so
 * one file still feeds the serial whole-stream solve unchanged -- that is what
 * keeps the conformance gate's 2-pass recon-match (serial pass 2, --dump-recon)
 * reading a stats file that a threaded pass 1 wrote. A file with no markers is
 * a serial pass 1's, and pass 2 stays on the serial path for it. */

 * lone serial encoder -- including the longest, which IS the wall. On a 25-GOP
 * 720p clip built as one 250-frame shot against 24 of 25 frames, t18 measured
 * 11.07 s, and the pole alone at one thread is 10.22 s of it: the other 71% of
 * the frames finish inside the pole and 14 of 18 cores idle (CPU/wall 3.8x,
 * against 13.9x for the arithmetic split of the same clip).
 *
 * Two scheduling-only measures answer that, and neither touches the
 * g == n_gops path above:
 *
 * - Hand the queue out longest-first. A straggler cannot recruit a sibling's
 * thread once it is already running, so the only cheap defence is to start
 * it first; display order is otherwise free to schedule the long pole last.
 *
 * - Size the wavefront to the GOP rather than to the worker. The worker opens
 * a fresh encoder per GOP, so this is free, and a 250-frame GOP and a
 * 25-frame one plainly do not want the same width. The share that stops GOP
 * i being the floor is the one that finishes it inside the throughput bound
 * total/nthreads -- i.e. len_i * nthreads / total -- which needs no constant
 * of its own. On the pole that is 6 threads, and 6 threads codes it in
 * 2.38 s against a 2.43 s bound, so the pole lands exactly on the bound.
 *
 * A minimum share under that formula is REJECTED by measurement. The theory
 * is that a lone GOP still stalls on its own gates, ramps and drain, so a
 * share of 1 leaves nothing to cover them -- and the oversubscription note above
 * says exactly that. Swept at t18 (best of 3, ms, floor applied after the
 * formula):
 *
 * floor 1 2 3 4 6
 * uneven_720p 3444 4102 3951 5098 5085
 * sintel_720p 2739 2875 3001 2569 2673
 *
 * uneven_720p wants no floor at all, and not marginally: a floor is threads
 * handed to 24 short GOPs that cannot use them, taken from the pole that can.
 * sintel_720p does not order its column at all -- 1 beats 2 beats 3, then 4
 * beats all three -- and a knob whose response is not monotonic is not being
 * measured on this box (an identical-arms null reads 1.013x on medians with a
 * 38% spread between the fastest and slowest of 14 runs). So sintel cannot pay
 * for the constant either, and uneven actively refuses it: no floor.

 * whatever the order -- applied without a word would make
 * `--crf 23 --bitrate 5000` produce a file byte-identical to plain
 * `--bitrate 5000`, with nothing saying the CRF had been dropped. That trap
 * has cost this project once: a CRF-mode run with no bitrate target was
 * read by our own harness as an ABR undershoot.
 *
 * Two things are wrong there and they are separable. The silence is the
 * bug; the precedence is a disagreement. x264 resolves the same clash by
 * letting the LAST flag on the command line win (each of its rc options
 * assigns i_rc_method as it is parsed), so under a fixed precedence
 * identical command lines would choose different modes on the two encoders
 * with no diagnostic on either.
 *
 * Both are handled the same way: x264's last-flag-wins, and say what was
 * dropped. Matching rather than erroring is the deliberate half:
 *
 * - It is the direction the API enums take too.
 * - Appending a flag to override an earlier one is how last-wins is used
 * on purpose, by every wrapper script that has a base argument list and
 * a per-run tail. An error would break that pattern, and it would break
 * this repo's own scripts/w2_canary.sh, which appends --crf/--bitrate to
 * a base line carrying --qp 26.
 * - Nothing that runs stops running, so exit codes are unchanged.
 *
 * So `--bitrate X --crf Y` is CRF, and `--crf Y --qp Z` and
 * `--bitrate X --qp Z` are constant QP. Each of those prints the warning
 * below, so the bits move only where the user is told they moved.
 *
 * --pass is not in the contest. It is not a mode on the command line, it is
 * a mode plus a stats round-trip whose target is --bitrate; 2-pass CRF is
 * not implemented here, so a --crf given alongside it is genuinely dropped
